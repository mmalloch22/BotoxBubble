<h2 style="color: #cd7fc1;">What are Injectables?</h2>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">Injectable treatments can be used to relax facial muscles to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and folds. Additionally, injectables can also be used to improve contours in order to promote stronger facial structure and to add volume to areas such as the lips and under eyes.

    <div class="col-sm-4"><h4>Botox</h4></div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"><h4>Dysport</h4></div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"><h4>Juvederm</h4></div>

    <div class="col-sm-4"><h4><img src="images\dysport logo.png" width="90%" height="50%"></h4></h4></div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">Botox is the commercial name for Botulinum toxin which is a neurotoxin protein which is made from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. This injection prevents the release of acetylcholine therefore causing a temporary paralysis of the muscles. Although the thought of injecting toxins into the face may sound scary, these microdose injections are FDA approved and have very few adverse side effects. In turn, these injections will relax the facial muscles and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">Dysport and Botox have many similarities in that they are nearly identical in biochemical makeup but differ in the amount of protein amounts that they contain. Dysport is specifically designed for the glabella region of the face which sits between the eyebrows. These lines are typically deeper and therefore require the slightly stronger Dysport alternative which is used for moderate to severe wrinkles. </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">Juvederm is one of the most commonly used dermal fillers on the market. This injectable treatment is largely composed of hyaluronic acid which holds 1000x its weight in water within the cells of the skin. This makes Juvederm an excellent choice for a filler as it plumps the skin to reduce the appearance of fine lines and increase the volume of the lips.</div>

<h2>How Long Do Results Last?</h2>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">Depending on the site of injection the time that the results can vary significantly. For example Botox can last anywhere from 2-6 months and Juvederm can go without top up applications for 6-12 months. For more information talk to a registered Aesthetician.</div>
